    "An AlTar application is based on the [pyre](https://github.com/pyre/pyre) framework. Compared with traditional Python programming, the `pyre` framework provides enhanced features for developing high performance scientific applications, including\n",
    "\n",
    "- It introduces a new programming model based on configurable components. A configurable component can be an attribute/parameter, or a method/protocol which may have different implementations. The latter will be especially helpful for users to swap between different algorithms/methods for a given procedure at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configurable components also offer users an easy way to configure parameters and settings in an application. To pass parameters through command line (e.g, by `argparse`) and property `setter` is usually a formidable task for applications with a large parameter set. In pyre, this can be done by one `json`-type configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An AlTar/pyre application can deploy itself automatically to different computing platforms, such as a standalone computer, GPU workstations, computer clusters or clouds, with a simple change of the `shell` configuration, a configurable component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyre also integrates high performance scientific libraries such as [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (for linear algebra and statistics), and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (for GPU accelerated computing). It also offers an easy procedure for users to develop their own applications with mixed Python/C/C++/Fortran/CUDA programming, to achieve both high performance and user-friendly interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a `Hello world!` application to demonstrate how an AlTar application, with configurable components, is constructed and runs slightly differently from conventional Python scripts."
